## RoboRally Rules

### Setup

1. First of all you have to host a match where your friends can join to.
2. Together you have to choose a course which you want to play with. This can even be a custom course which only the host has to have installed.
3. Now every player chooses a robot.
4. After that every player has to place its Robot on the map. The order is random.

### Play

The game is played in rounds. Each round is made out of 5 phases:

1. The upgrade phase:
   - During the upgrade phase each player can buy upgrade cards for the energy cubes he has.
2. The programming phase:
   - Each player gets an amount of programming cards. 
   - Every player has to place the maximum of the programming cards he is able to.
3. The power-down-announce phase:
   - Each player can now tell that they want to power down after this round
4. The register phase:
   - Now the robots gets moved like their programming cards tell them too in five register phases. 
     - The robots get moved once after another so the priority beacon tells them in which order they have to move.
     - When every robot has moved the board elements gets triggered.
5. End of turn effects:
   - There are map fields which only do something after the 5th register phase *More here*

### Phases

#### Upgrade Phase

At the start of every round is the upgrade phase.

##### Cards

There are two card types:

- Permanent upgrade
- Temporary upgrade

Permanent cards gives the robot a buff and you can have a maximum amount of three.
Temporary cards can be always be played and you can have a maximum amount of three.

##### Refill

If there are still all upgrade cards left in shop they will all get removed from the match. Otherwise, so many cards will be added to the card shop so that there are as many as players again.

##### Purchase

In this phase everyone can buy **one** upgrade card. Again the sequence for purchasing is specified by the priority beacon. These cards get bought with the energy cubes. The price of each upgrade card is written on the card. If you want to buy a card but you have to many of these type already you are able to put one away.

#### Programming phase
